The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations.  It attempts to access the data from a Firebase query snapshot before the data has fully loaded, resulting in undefined values.

```javascript
const querySnapshot = await getDocs(query);
const cityRef = doc(db, "cities", querySnapshot.docs[0].id);
const citySnap = await getDoc(cityRef);
console.log(citySnap.data().name); // This might cause an error if the data hasn't loaded
```
