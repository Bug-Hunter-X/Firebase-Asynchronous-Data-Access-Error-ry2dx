This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Firebase when dealing with asynchronous data retrieval. The `bug.js` file showcases the erroneous code that attempts to access data before it is fully loaded from the database. This often results in unexpected undefined values or runtime errors. The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected approach, using promises to ensure the data is fully loaded before access. This detailed example illustrates the importance of asynchronous operation handling in Firebase applications.  The solution ensures correct data handling and prevents undefined value errors.
